# montecarlo

  Simple Monte Carlo simulation for testing expectancy of a system over a
  certain number of trades.  This simulation is structured in days, where one or
  more trades are executed each day. Risk per day is divided by the number of
  trades per day if you want to test distributing the risk equally among X
  number of trades each day.
